# Space Shooter Game

Tutorial Link: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial

This is a 3D arcade-style space shooter game. Use the arrow keys to control the ship, and press CTRL to fire lasers. Gain points by destroying the asteroids.

I chose this tutorial because it was described as beginner-friendly, but still introduced some basics of writing code in C#. I feel comfortable with using visual interfaces (like Scratch) and wanted to advance to something more challenging, but not overwhelming.

The hardest part of the tutorial was working around the incompatibilities with the version of Unity that I was using. The tutorial was intended for users of Unity 4.6, which has certain features that were later changed or rendered obsolete.
