Project done by Steven Chea

This is a 3D arcade-style space shooter game. Use the arrow keys to control the ship, and press CTRL to fire lasers. Gain points by destroying the asteroids.

I chose this tutorial because it was described as beginner-friendly, but still introduced some basics of writing code in C#. I feel comfortable with using visual interfaces (like Scratch) and wanted to advance to something more challenging, but not overwhelming.

The hardest part of the tutorial was working around the incompatibilities with the version of Unity that I was using. The tutorial was designed for an older version of Unity, which has certain features that were later changed or rendered obsolete. I had to read about solutions online, analyze my code deeply, and do a lot of trial-and-error to get it working as intended.

From doing this tutorial, I developed a stronger understanding of the structure of Unity; such as the relationship between parent and child elements in the hierarchy and the benefits of using prefab elements.
